# UWP-Locker 🔒🖱️

A simple mouse locker for UWP apps, built out of pure frustration and a little caffeine.

## Why?

So... I was playing Minecraft (the MS Store version, yes, the cursed UWP one), and my damn cursor kept leaving the window like it had a better place to be — clicking random shit on my desktop.  
I got tired of that crap, so I coded this tiny tool to lock the cursor *inside* the UWP window. Problem solved.

## How to use?

- Just press the `|` key (yep, the one above the **Tab** key) to **lock** the mouse inside the active window.
- Press it again to **unlock**.

## Want to tweak it?

You can change the border detection values directly in the `.ahk` source code if it doesn’t fit your setup.

## Requirements

- [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (this script won’t work without it, obviously).

## Note

It’s a small script, nothing fancy — but if it saved you from rage-quitting like it saved me, drop a ⭐ or share it with another Minecraft survivor 😅.
