# UWP-Locker
A mouse locker for UWP Aps

This can help if you are using a UWP style app in Windows and you want to keep the cursor inside the window.
I codded this cause i was playing Minecraft from MS-Store, but my cursor was going outside the window while I
was playing, and that was annoying, so, I codded this. This isnÂ´t so much, but it can help somebody with the
same problem :D

If you need, you always can configure the border detection in the source of the .ahk.
